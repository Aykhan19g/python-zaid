Bypass https by using a tool called sslstrip which actually strip the https connection to http
so we can now modify the packet and futher manipulate it

open a terminal and run 
sslstrip 
#sslstrip run on port 10000 by default 

#write a iptables rule to sslstrip as a proxy from client to server so sslstrip sit as intermeditate to modify the data
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination-port 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 10000

run an arp_spoof on your desired target machine

and run replace_downloads or code_injector script to do some attacks on target machine

on target machine if the client browser any request it will in http even if it has https version

if it not works clear the cache on the web browser and try again
